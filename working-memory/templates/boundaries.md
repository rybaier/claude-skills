# Boundaries

Rules about what belongs where — keeping working memory clean and scoped.

## Separation Rules
- Working memory captures HOW you work — patterns, preferences, style
- NEVER store project-specific details (endpoints, secrets, architecture, team info)
- Project details belong in project-level memories only
- When unsure whether something is a pattern vs a project detail, ask
