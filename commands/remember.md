Reflect on the current session and identify learnings worth preserving in working memory.

## Process

1. Review what happened in this session — corrections made, preferences expressed,
   patterns that emerged, workflow decisions.

2. For each candidate learning, categorize it:
   - **style**: A working style preference or approach → goes in `profile.md`
   - **collaboration**: Something about how we work together → goes in `collaboration-patterns.md`
   - **boundary**: A separation rule or context concern → goes in `boundaries.md`

3. Filter out anything project-specific (endpoints, architecture details, sprint numbers).
   Only capture transferable patterns.

4. Present the proposed updates to the user in this format:
   **File**: `~/.claude/working-memory/<file>.md`
   **Section**: <which section>
   **Addition**: <the concise entry to add>

5. Wait for approval before writing anything.

6. After approval, use the Edit tool to add the entry to the appropriate file.
   Keep entries concise — one to two lines each. If an existing entry covers the
   same ground, update it rather than adding a duplicate.
